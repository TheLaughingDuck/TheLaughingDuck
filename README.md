### Hi there, I'm Simon 👋
🎓 I'm a Master's student of Data Analysis, Statistics and Machine Learning coming from a background of mathematical statistics and with great interest in investigating various kinds of data and machine learning models, always with a focus on investigating, understanding, and applying.

🧠 Most recently, in my Master's Thesis, I have worked on brain tumour diagnosis classification based on fusion of 3D-MRI sequences using deep learning, specifically using a ViT and CNN's. It has been a very interesting project, providing me with a lot of hands-on experience with research and model training using PyTorch.

👨‍🔬 I am highly motivated by the desire to learn new things and develop my analytical abilities. My main priority is to ensure great quality of my work. I consider myself a calm, analytical person, with a proficiency in simplifying and summarizing my results.

### I have experience working with 
- Python (PyTorch, keras, pyspark)
- R (tidyverse, package development)
- SQL
