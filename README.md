### Hi there, I'm Simon 👋
🎓 I'm a Master's student of Statistics and Machine Learning coming from a background of mathematical statistics and with great interest in investigating various kinds of data and machine learning models, always with a focus on investigating, understanding, and applying.

🧠 Most recently, in my Master's Thesis, I worked on brain tumour diagnosis classification based on fusion of 3D-MRI sequences using deep learning, specifically using Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. It was a very interesting project, providing me with a lot of hands-on experience with research and custom model training using PyTorch.

👨‍🔬 I am highly motivated by the desire to learn new things and develop my analytical and technical abilities. I am highly solution oriented, and I love coming up with cool use cases when learning new techniques and methods. I excel when working on a clearly defined problem, but I also enjoy less clear tasks, requiring an investigative and explorative process. I love to learn, to simplify and to summarise my findings, and the joy it brings to teach.

### I have experience working with
- Python (PyTorch, keras, pyspark)
- Machine Learning
- Statistics, statistical modeling
- R (tidyverse, package development)
- SQLite
