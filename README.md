# Hi there, I'm Simon 👋
🎓 Master's student of Statistics and Machine Learning at Linköping University.

🎓 Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Statistics from Stockholm University.

📖 A highly motivated, technical and analytical problem solver.

📖 I love learning new concepts, simplifying them, and the pure joy it brings to teach others.

## I'm currently working on
👨‍💻 Various Machine Learning projects.

👨‍💻 A Data Warehouse case project for a fictional library.

👨‍💻 A custom voice Assistant written in python, and run on a Raspberry Pi.

## I have previously worked on
🛠️ [My Master's Thesis](https://github.com/TheLaughingDuck/Master_Thesis), deep learning-based 3D MRI classification of brain tumour diagnosis, specifically with ViT and CNN. 

🛠️ Various Machine Learning, and Statistical projects as part of my education.

🛠️ [My Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/TheLaughingDuck/KANDIDAT_Simulation) on various initialization techniques for the k-means algorithm.

🛠️ [A Work Clock](https://github.com/TheLaughingDuck/Work_clock) for keeping track of how much time you've worked and when. This started as a personal tool for my own need to track this data. Over time I've added some nice features such as saving data to a sqlite database and tracking individual work sessions. I'm very happy with the current version :)

🛠️ [A couple of small projects](https://github.com/TheLaughingDuck/Small_Projects) I'm quite proud of. A very handy clock to keep track of daily working hours, some useful machine learning helpers, and a program that automates task creation for Todoist, the task management application.

## I have experience working with
- Python (PyTorch, keras, pyspark)
- Machine Learning
- Statistics, statistical modeling
- R (tidyverse, package development)
- SQLite


<!--
🎓 I'm a Master's student of Statistics and Machine Learning coming from a background of mathematical statistics and with great interest in investigating various kinds of data and machine learning models, always with a focus on investigating, understanding, and applying.

🧠 Most recently, in my Master's Thesis, I worked on brain tumour diagnosis classification based on fusion of 3D-MRI sequences using deep learning, specifically using Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. It was a very interesting project, providing me with a lot of hands-on experience with research and custom model training using PyTorch.

👨‍🔬 I am highly motivated by the desire to learn new things and develop my analytical and technical abilities. I am highly solution oriented, and I love coming up with cool use cases when learning new techniques and methods. I excel when working on a clearly defined problem, but I also enjoy less clear tasks, requiring an investigative and explorative process. I love to learn, to simplify and to summarise my findings, and the joy it brings to teach.
